# Absenteeism-Model-using-Logistic-Regression
Developed a machine learning model to predict excessive absenteeism and draw out valuable results.

Built a machine learning model to predict excessive absenteeism, achieving 73.6% accuracy. Conducted data preprocessing, EDA, and feature engineering. Employed logistic regression with backward elimination for optimization. Deployed the model with Pickle and visualized results using Tableau.

Run the codes using Jupyter Notebook and go in this order 
First execute **Absenteeism Preprocessing File**   
then **Absenteeism Model file** 
the module will be automatically created 

then execute the **Loading the Absenteeism Module**
